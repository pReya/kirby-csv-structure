# kirby-csv-structure

There are some examples of how to read and write to a CSV file in Kirby. However all of them convert CSV records into subpages. This plugin converts CSV files into a structure field, which is a nice equivalent for a spreadsheet and allows faster editing in the Kirby panel, compared to subpages.

Under the hood, this plugin uses the fantastic [thephpleague/csv](https://github.com/thephpleague/csv) library for reading and writing to CSV files.
